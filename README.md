# VBA_Stocks

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
 The purpose of the project was to decrease the amount of time the code took to run in order to process more data more quickly.
## Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
- Refactoring code can speed up the time it takes for the code to run. If the code is going to be used often and the run time is long enough, it can save the user a lot of time.
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
- The VBA script is for stock analysis and could be updated daily, with it being better for the code to run faster since it involves stocks. As for the cons, there is little point in refactoring with a small amount of data. The time spent refactoring the code might cost the coder more time than not doing so, depending on the data and how long the code took to run initially.
